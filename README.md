# Earth Engine API Testing with GitHub Actions

This project sets up a GitHub Actions workflow to test the installation and functionality of the Google Earth Engine API using `pip install earthengine-api`. It includes a simple test script (`test.py`) that initializes the API and retrieves the elevation of Mount Everest.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account**: To host the repository and run GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Google Earth Engine Access**: You must have an active Earth Engine account.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and pushing changes.
- **Earth Engine Python API**: Installed locally to generate credentials.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thekester/earthengine-api-test.git
cd earthengine-api-test
```

### 2. Create the Test Script

Create a file named `test.py` at the root of the project with the following content:

```python
import ee
import json
import os

# Load credentials from the environment variable
stored = json.loads(os.getenv("EARTHENGINE_TOKEN"))

# Write credentials to the appropriate Earth Engine credentials file
credentials_file = os.path.expanduser("~/.config/earthengine/credentials")
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(credentials_file), exist_ok=True)  # Ensure the directory exists
with open(credentials_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(stored, f)

# Initialize the Earth Engine API
ee.Initialize()

# Print a greeting message from the Earth Engine servers
print(ee.String("Greetings from the Earth Engine servers!").getInfo())

# Test the API: Print the elevation of Mount Everest
dem = ee.Image('USGS/SRTMGL1_003')
xy = ee.Geometry.Point([86.9250, 27.9881])
elev = dem.sample(xy, 30).first().get('elevation').getInfo()
print('Mount Everest elevation (m):', elev)

# Verify that the elevation is a positive number
assert elev > 0, "Error: Elevation should be a positive number."

print("Test passed: The elevation of Mount Everest was retrieved successfully.")
```

### 3. Configure the GitHub Actions Workflow

In the `.github/workflows/` directory, create a file named `main.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Test Earth Engine Script

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Use the latest stable version (v4)

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install earthengine-api

      - name: Configure Earth Engine token
        env:
          EARTHENGINE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.EARTHENGINE_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.config/earthengine
          echo "$EARTHENGINE_TOKEN" > ~/.config/earthengine/credentials

      - name: Run Earth Engine Script
        env:
          EARTHENGINE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.EARTHENGINE_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          python test.py
```

### 4. Obtain Earth Engine Credentials

Generate the credentials file by authenticating locally:

```bash
earthengine authenticate
```

- Follow the instructions to authorize access.
- A credentials file will be created as `~/.config/earthengine/credentials`.

```python
import json

# Function to reformat the JSON
def reformat_json(input_file, output_file):
    # Read the JSON from the input file
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Write the reformatted JSON to the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, separators=(',', ':'), ensure_ascii=False)

# Specify the input and output file names
input_file = 'input.json'  # Replace with your input file name
output_file = 'output.json'  # Replace with your output file name

# Call the function to reformat the JSON
reformat_json(input_file, output_file)

print(f"The JSON has been reformatted and saved to '{output_file}'.")
```

```json
{
    "client_id": "yourclientid.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_secret": "yourclientsecret",
    "refresh_token": "yourrefreshtoken",
    "project": "yourprojectid"
}
```

Pleas enote taht you can find the projectid on https://console.cloud.google.com/ it opens for example https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?pli=1&project=ee-yourproject so here the projectid is ee-yourproject

Take the contnet of the generated output.json

```json
{"client_id":"yourclientid.apps.googleusercontent.com","client_secret":"yourclientsecret","refresh_token":"yourrefreshtoken","project":"yourprojectid"}
```

### 5. Set Up the GitHub Secret

To allow the workflow to access your credentials without exposing them:

1. Access your repository settings on GitHub.
2. Click on "Secrets and variables" in the sidebar, then "Actions".
3. Click on "New repository secret".
4. Name the secret `EARTHENGINE_TOKEN`.
6. Copy the entire content of the output.json and paste it into the value field of the secret.
8. Save the secret by clicking "Add secret".

Hereâ€™s an example image showing how to configure the secret in GitHub:

### 6. Commit and Push Changes

Add the files to version control, commit, and push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure Earth Engine API test with GitHub Actions"
git push origin main
```

### 7. Verify the Workflow Execution

- Go to the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub.
- You should see the workflow "Earth Engine API Test" running.
- Monitor the logs to ensure all steps complete successfully.
- Check the script output to confirm that the elevation of Mount Everest is correctly displayed.

## Important Notes

### Credential Security

- Never commit your credentials or secrets into the source code.
- Always use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information securely.
- Do not share your credentials in public forums or repositories.

### Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors**: Verify that the `EARTHENGINE_TOKEN` secret is correctly configured and that the JSON is valid.
- **Dependency Issues**: Ensure that `earthengine-api` is installed correctly.
- **Permission Issues**: Check that your Earth Engine account has the necessary permissions.

## Expected Output Example

If everything works correctly, you should see an output similar to the following in the workflow logs:

```yaml
Greetings from the Earth Engine servers!
Mount Everest elevation (m): 8729
Test passed: The elevation of Mount Everest was retrieved successfully.
```
